// CONSIDER CREATING DIFFERENT FILES LIKE Semantics.c FOR  
// EACH PROJECT COMPONENT THAT YOU ARE TRYING TO SATISFY!!!

1. WORK WITH BEN AND MAKE SURE ALL YOUR INTEGER STUFF
   (THE FIRST PART OF THE CHECKLIST) IS WORKING!

2. WORK WITH BEN AND FIGURE OUT WHY YOU CANNOT HAVE 
   EXPRESSIONS LIKE (() || ())!

3. SEE IF YOU CAN FIX THE ISSUE WITH THE "GREATER THAN" 
   OPERATOR (>). IT DOES NOT SEEM TO BE WORKING AT THE
   MOMENT! THE AND OPERATOR ALSO SEEMS TO BE HAVING ISSUES!

3. CHECK AND SEE IF YOU HAVE THE EXPRESSIONS CORRECT 
   IN YOUR GRAMMAR!

4. ALSO SEE IF YOU CAN USE THE ENUM THAT BENNETT WAS 
   TALKING ABOUT TO SIMPLIFY THE NUMBER OF FUNCTIONS 
   THAT YOU NEED TO RIGHT IN YOUR Semantics.c FILE! 

5. TRY TO COMPLETE I/O PORTION OF THE PROJECT AS WELL
   AS THE CONTROL STRUCTURES PORTION OF THE PROJECT
   AS WELL!
