TEST 1: Series of Commands to test Homework 3:
===============================================

1. bison -d h3.y
2. flex h3.l
3. gcc -o h3 h3.tab.c lex.yy.c semantics.c SymTab.c IOMngr.c main.c -fsanitize=address

===============================================
NOTES:

// COMPILING WITH gdb WILL HELP YOU DEBUG YOUR CODE EASIER.

// There is some memory management that you may have to worry about 
// for homework 3.

// Also, make use of the startIterator and nextEntry functions in 
// the Symbol Table file class to move through the symbol table(s)
// in your print statement function as well as your other functions.

// When you create your print method for homework 3, make sure that
// you create a separate, simple print function for printing out 
// the attributes (other symbol tables) of each attribute for each
// item in the main symbol table. Again, you can use the startIterator
// and nextEntry functions in the Symbol Table file for this.

===============================================

/*
    Generate a hash value for the table.
    This function was not provided in the .h
    file by the professor. I created it myself. 
*/
// --> SHOULD NOT HAVE THIS IN THE .h FILE!!!
//int createHashValue(int size, char *name);

/*
    Print out the symbol table that is passed
    through this function. The table is 
    represented as an array of linked lists 
    that is printed out.
*/
// --> SHOULD NOT HAVE THIS IN THE .h FILE!!!
//void printSymbolTable(SymTab *table);
